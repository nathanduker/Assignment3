# Notes & Process

<!-- How you built this project - Include images, gifs, and notes here -->

For this week's project, I wanted to try and build something with a focus on simply pulling data from somewhere and then displaying it. To make it more fun and interesting, I decided to focus on the theme of Pokemon. It's lighthearted, and my childhood. A key item from the Pokemon franchise is the Pokedex, a device that exists to catalogue every single Pokemon species in existence. It's a classic item that synonymous with the franchise. With today's online services, API's, text to speech and AI, building a web based Pokedex is a fun project that any developer can take on for fun!

When I started out, acdmittedly I hadn't sketched out a specific layout. What I did know was that I wanted to make it so that the site itself is very reminiscent of a Pokedex. The screenshot below should emulate what I had in mind in terms of the format. Pokedex screen at the top, front and center. Pokedex buttons at the bottom. Plain and simple.

## Process & Documentation

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
I realise that an issue that I tend to struggle with is figuring out how positioning with CSS works and how to properly structure an HTML file for the sake of styling it.
